# Description
This project focuses on applying large-scale hypothesis testing to detect anomalies in online transaction data, such as fraudulent activities or unusual purchasing behaviors. The goal is to test whether certain patterns in the data deviate significantly from the norm, considering the large volume of data and multiple comparisons.

## Data Selection:
Use a large dataset of online transactions.

## Problem Formulation:
Define multiple hypotheses based on the data. Examples:
Null Hypothesis: The distribution of transaction amounts for a given user or region matches the overall transaction distribution.
Alternate Hypothesis: The transaction distribution deviates significantly, indicating anomalous activity.

## Statistical Approach:
### Perform hypothesis tests:
Use statistical tests like the t-test, Z-test, or Chi-squared test for hypothesis testing across features (e.g., transaction amounts, time of day, frequency).
If comparing distributions, use tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Mann-Whitney U test.

### Correct for multiple testing:
Apply techniques like:
Bonferroni correction: Adjust p-values to control the family-wise error rate (FWER).
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure: Control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to balance sensitivity and specificity.

## Big Data Processing:
Use distributed computing frameworks to handle large datasets:
Apache Spark: Perform distributed data processing and statistical tests.
Hadoop with MapReduce (optional): Implement scalable hypothesis testing pipelines.

## Result Interpretation and Visualization:
Identify transactions or features flagged as anomalous.
Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize distributions, p-values, and corrected significance levels.
Generate reports showing the proportion of flagged hypotheses and their potential business impact.
