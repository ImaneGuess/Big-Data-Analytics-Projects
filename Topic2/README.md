# Description
Create a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their preferences. The system will utilize user ratings, book metadata (e.g., genre, author), and collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations. Additionally, users can search for books by title or genre, and the system will display suggestions tailored to their interests.

##Data Selection:
Use the Goodreads Book Dataset or Book-Crossing Dataset to get user ratings and book metadata.

##Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Handle missing values in user ratings or book metadata.
Transform categorical features like genres into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).

##Algorithm Implementation:
###Collaborative Filtering:
Use Matrix Factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user ratings for books they haven't rated yet.
Libraries: Surprise, Scikit-learn.
###Content-Based Filtering:
Compute similarity between books using metadata (e.g., genres, authors) with cosine similarity or TF-IDF for textual features.
Library: Scikit-learn.
###Hybrid Approach:
Combine collaborative and content-based approaches for better recommendations.

##Evaluation:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for rating prediction or Precision@K/Recall@K for top-K recommendations.

##Output:
Generate a list of recommended books for a given user ID or simulate recommendations for multiple users.

# Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for similarity computations and evaluation.
Surprise for collaborative filtering.
