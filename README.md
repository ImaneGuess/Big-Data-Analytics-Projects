# Big-Data-Analytics-Projects

This portfolio is a collection of 3 projects from the few last chapters of the Big Data Analytics Class. Specifically I chose Vision Transformers for chapter 7 (Regressions to Transformers), Identifying Anomalous Online Transactions for chapter 8 (Large Scale Hypothesis Testing), and Book Recommendation System for chapter 9 (Recommendation Systems).
